Answer:

find /var/log -type f -name "*.log" -size +1M -mtime -7 -exec sh -c 'gzip "$1" && mv "$1.gz" /backup/logs' _ {} \; 2>/dev/null

Explanation:
find /var/log: Search in the /var/log directory.
-type f: Only find files, not directories.
-name "*.log": Find files ending with .log.
-size +1M: Only include files larger than 1 megabyte.
-mtime -7: Only include files modified in the last 7 days.
-exec sh -c 'gzip "$1" && mv "$1.gz" /backup/logs' _ {}: For each file found:
Compress the file using gzip.
Move the compressed file (.gz) to /backup/logs.
$1 is the placeholder for the found file.
2>/dev/null: Suppress any error messages by redirecting them to /dev/null.
