Difficulty (3/10): 
You have a web server running on RHEL 9 with SELinux enabled. 
After placing your website files in /srv/myweb, you notice that NGINX cannot serve the content. 
The error log shows permission denied errors.


Task:
Identify the current SELinux context of /srv/myweb.
Apply the correct SELinux context so NGINX can serve files from this directory.
Verify the changes are persistent.















































































#create the directory if it hasn't been made already.
mkdir -p /srv/myweb

#this will show that the context is wrong for myweb
ls -lZ /srv

#apply new context
semanage fcontext -at httpd_sys_content_t "/srv(.*)?"
restorecon -Rv /srv

#check the context, it will be changed
ls -lZ /srv

#restart httpd to ensure the web server picks up the new configuration
systemctl restart httpd

#reboot to check
reboot
