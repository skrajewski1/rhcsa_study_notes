##### Note to Reader #####

I created this txt file so that I would have a place to keep my notes for future studying as I got tired of writing notes by hand.
This is meant for the RHCSA exam offered by RedHat.
It is free to use by others if you need something quick to review.
Scroll through the txt file or use Ctrl-F to search for terms.
Not meant to be 100% thorough it's just my notes as I go through material for the review.
